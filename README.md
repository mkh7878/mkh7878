## Hi there 👋

<!--
## 🎨 Web & Email Designer | 💻 Creative Developer

Specialising in **website** and **email design**, I create and code immersive, accessible digital experiences — blending my programming skills with a background in visual design.

My work in **creative computing** explores the intersection of **audio** 🔊 and **visual** 👁️ experiences. I'm especially fascinated by how visualising music can reshape how it's perceived and even composed. This began with my **Master’s dissertation**, which you can check out [here](https://www.meaghanhorak.com/pages/syncomp.html).
