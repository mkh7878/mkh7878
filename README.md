## ðŸŽ¨ Web & Email Designer | ðŸ’» Creative Developer

Specialising in **website** and **email design**, I create and code immersive, accessible digital experiences â€” blending my programming skills with a background in visual design.

## Web and Graphic Design:

Previous titles include **Digital Experience Specialist** at Richline Digital, **Head of Visuals and Technology** at Off Hand Co and **Email Designer** at Roadrunner Sports. [Portfolio With Design Work](https://meaghanhorak.com)

## Creative Technology:

My work in **creative computing** explores the intersection of audio and visual experiences.  I am especially interested in how the ability to visualise music affects the way it is perceived and composed. I began this work during my masters degree at University of the Arts London Creative Computing Institute

## Projects exploring audiovisual technologies:
### [Visual Theremin](https://github.com/mkh7878/VisualTheramin): 
an application that allows the user to do simple drawings while playing a  D minor pentatonic scale. Made with C++ in Open Frameworks using the Maximillian Add-On.

### [VAE-Created Live Video Application](https://github.com/mkh7878/vae-videoaudio): 
In an attempt to better understand machine learning, I created from scratch my very own VAE (Variational AutoEncoder) that I trained on stills from short films. Then I created an application that blended them into video that reacted to live audio. I ran out of time on this project at uni but would like to return to this concept in the future.

### Synesthetic Composition
My **Masterâ€™s dissertation** involved the development of the [Synesthetic Composition application (SynComp App)](https://www.meaghanhorak.com/pages/syncomp.html), a Python-based tool designed to create a synesthetic experience by linking musical input with dynamic visual output. I plan to continue this work by incorporating reactive visuals into live music performances.

## Other Notable Projects

### [Resume Chatbot](https://github.com/mkh7878/meaghan-resume): 
This is a Flask-based application that serves as a chatbot for answering questions about my resume. The application utilizes the OpenAI API, integrated through the LangChain framework, to respond to use questions about my background and professional experience. It got too expensive to host on my website through Heroku so I removed it, but it did work and was pretty cool. Please feel free to use the code to make your own chat bot for your CV.

### [EndGame](https://github.com/AdvaitU/endgame): 
A video game exploring alternative control systems - The game runs using a custom built accelerometer based controller that lets the player assume the role of a football - both in the game and physically in their hand. Endgame is a video game based in a post-apocalyptic fictional London. The game lets you take the control of AI-Football Harold as you navigate a post-nuclear fictional London gathering intelligence from your network of football spy colleagues and report to release the overseer Erik Ten Haag from his long imprisonment in a telephone box. <br><br>
I collaborated with [Avdait Ukidve](https://github.com/AdvaitU) on this project. I personally worked extensively on the [worldbuilding](https://github.com/AdvaitU/endgame/blob/main/Worldbuilding.md), graphics, and audio design for the game.

### [Pop-Up Smash Pro](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XykHu9C6Fco):
Pop Up Smash Pro was a game made and exhibited at the Portals of Perception Showcase at The Hub, Eagle Wharf, London SE. The game contains a Windows-95 themed computer screen on a projected surface containing various popups ranging from the annoying to the absurd that appear incessantly as the player is tasked with closing each one of them before the screen fills up. The interaction is achieved through conductive tape connected to the electrodes of a Bare Conductive Touch Board relaying the touch to a Processing sketch. 
<br><br>
I collaborated with a group of colleagues on this project. I personally worked on the the UX/UI design, the programming using Processing, audio design, and the physical building of the game.

### [Wearable Robotics "Inside Out"](https://github.com/mkh7878/inside-out-arduino):
"Inside Out" was a project using Arduino. I created a jacket that had sensors to monitor the wearer's breating, and sound input with the idea that this technology could be used in performances to make the clothing react to the wearer (change colors when heart rate or breathing changes) or change in time with music. I also experimented with nitinol wire to make parts of the clothes move. It was my first time using Arduino and soldering, and I only lit 2 things on fire, so feeling proud of this. I am interested in exploring the concept of wearable robotics in the future. [Link to Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYf4gb7Uf-E)

### [Solar System](https://github.com/mkh7878/creativecoding1finalproject):
This project was for uni and I am very proud of it because I'm a huge nerd for space (not a scientist, just a fan of the concept). I was watching Brian Cox's "The Planets" documentary while we learned Three.js, so I was inspired to make this animation of the solar system (scale is warped to make the experience user friendly - I believe it's all commented in the code). I even used trig for the first time since high school. [You can play with it yourself here](https://mimicproject.com/code/9b7d58aa-caa0-db8c-fd24-b43cc46ca6cf)
