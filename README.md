## 🎨 Web & Email Designer | 💻 Creative Developer

Specialising in **website** and **email design**, I create and code immersive, accessible digital experiences — blending my programming skills with a background in visual design.

Previous titles include **Digital Experience Specialist** at Richline Digital, **Head of Visuals and Technology** at Off Hand Co and **Email Designer** at Roadrunner Sports. [Portfolio With Design Work](https://meaghanhorak.com)

My work in **creative computing** explores the intersection of **audio** 🔊 and **visual** 👁️ experiences.  I am especially interested in how the ability to visualise music affects the way it is perceived and composed. I began this work during my masters degree at University of the Arts London Creative Computing Institute

### Projects exploring audiovisual technologies:
 [Visual Theremin](https://github.com/mkh7878/VisualTheramin): an application that allows the user to do simple drawings while playing a  D minor pentatonic scale. Made with C++ in Open Frameworks using the Maximillian Add-On.

 [VAE-Created Live Video Application](https://github.com/mkh7878/vae-videoaudio): In an attempt to better understand machine learning, I created from scratch my very own VAE (Variational AutoEncoder) that I trained on stills from short films. Then I created an application that blended them into video that reacted to live audio. I ran out of time on this project at uni but would like to return to this concept in the future.

My **Master’s dissertation** involved the development of the [Synesthetic Composition application (SynComp App)](https://www.meaghanhorak.com/pages/syncomp.html), a Python-based tool designed to create a synesthetic experience by linking musical input with dynamic visual output.
